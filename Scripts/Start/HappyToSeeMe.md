_Hello_, var(subName)  
chance(50, goto(Really Happy))  
Are you as happy to see me as I am to see you?  
answer(10, Are you happy to see me or not? _*grins*_)  
- **no** No?  
goto(You Must Know What I'm About To Do)  
- **yes** I'm glad to hear that var(subName)  
- **not happy, not** No?  
goto(You Must Know What I'm About To Do)  
- **I am happy, I'm happy** I'm glad to hear that var(subName)  


I've been thinking about all these fun ways to torment a _cock_  
And there's not a lot of guys who can handle that  
That's why I'm always glad to see you here willing to please me  
And willing to suffer _*grins*_  
Speaking of suffering...  
goto(Start Stroking)  

# You Must Know What I'm About To Do
You must know what I'm about to do to that _cock_ then _*grins*_  
But since you knew and logged on anyway  
I don't have to feel guilty about it *lol*  
goto(Start Stroking)  

# Really Happy
answer(I'm really happy to see you)  
- **why, how come, really, yeah** Because I've been thinking about your _cock_...  
...and how much I want it to suffer _*grins*_
goto(Start Stroking)
- **too, as, also** Aww that's so sweet  
goto(But I Get The Feeling)
- **thank, gracias, merci, nice, sweet, kind, means** You're welcome var(PetName)  
goto(But I Don't Know If You Should Thank Me)
The thing is...  
I've just been sitting here thinking of all these fun ways to make a _cock_ suffer  
And we both know how much fun yours is to play with  
goto(Start Stroking)

# But I Get The Feeling
But I get the feeling your _cock_ isn't as glad to see me as you are  
Especially considering what I'm about to do to it _*grins*_ 
goto(Start Stroking)

# But I Don't Know If You Should Thank Me  
But I don't know if you should really be thanking me  
Considering that the reason I'm so happy to see you  
Is that I finally get to torment that _cock_ of yours some more _*grins*_  

# Start Stroking
startStroking()
end()
