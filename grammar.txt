showButtImage() = @ShowButtImage

functions:

-DONE checkFlag - get value of a script-created boolean client flag, if True, execute a goto statement to the anchor provided as an argument
-DONE goto  - skip to the specified anchor - can only go forwards
-DONE chance - 2 params, 2 digit chance and command to execute on success
-NEEDS WORK ? - question function, looks for some input from the user and compares it to the list of options provided by the script
-DONE loopAnswer - executes a goto, sending the script back to the top of the list of options for the current question and repeats the process of handling user input
 -DONE var - get the value of an option variable
-DONE startStroking - tell sub to start stroking and set the flag that sub is stroking
-DONE stopStroking - tell sub to stop stroking and set the flag that sub is not stroking
-DOND randint - 2 params, generate a random integer between the two integer params and insert it in place of the call
-DONE end - marks the end of a script

anchor begins with # and must begin the line
vocab surrounded with _vocab_  <- Markdown italic
answers surrounded with [answers]
verbs utilize function notation
every token except vocab tokens and var() calls must be on a separate line
Dialog lines must be encapsulated with ""
